# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

## Project Overview
In this project we built an interactive dashboard to visualize the results of a recent experiment in which candidates' belly-buttons were sampled to determine which bacterial species were present. The dashboard allows participants the opportunity to search by their ID number to see charts documenting their demographic information, top 10 bacteria cultures found, cultures found per sample, and the frequency they clean the testing area. With this data and dashboard, scientists will hopefully make progress in determining a species that can synthesize proteins that taste like beef.
